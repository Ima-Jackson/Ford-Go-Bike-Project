## 2019 Ford Go-Bike  Exploration
## by Ima Jackson


## Dataset

The data set includes information about individual rides made in a bike-sharing system covering the greater San Francisco Bay area for Febrary, 2019. There are 183,412 bike trips in this dataset with 16 features. Each row contains information on individual rides made in a bike-sharing system covering the greater San Francisco Bay area.


## Summary of Findings

In the exploration, it was observed that trip duration does not depend on number of trips. I got to this conclusion after showing the relationship between gender and user type with trip duration. Male gender had a significant size difference in trip count, compared to other gender categories, however they had the least trip duration. The same applies with subscribers and customers, while subscribers had the highest trip records, they recorded the least trip duration, while the reverse was the case for customers. 

## Key Insights for Presentation

The presentation focuses on weekly and hourly distribution of trips for the univariate exploration. Bar plot was used to display these visuals. The highest number of trips were made on Thursday, more trips were recorded during the week within the hours of 7-9am in the morning, and 4-6pm in the evening, and the most popular start hour is 5pm. It was observed that eople go on trips more during the week, with a lesser number of trips taken on weekends. This is as a result of people going to work during peak hours in the mornings and returning home at peak hours in the evenings. The bivariate exploration of the user distribution of trips by weekday shows that there are more subscribers, and both users had the highest recorded trips on Thursday. The trip time distribution of users reveal that customers had more trip time, probably they go on longer trips more, unlike subscribers.This was done using bar plot. The multivariate exploration uses heatmap to plot visual showing trip duration distribution by gender and users, and it is observed that male gender subscribers had least trip duration time. Lastly, the bar plot was used to show weekly trip duration of users, with customers having the highest time during weekends.
